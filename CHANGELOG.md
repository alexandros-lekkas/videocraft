# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Sound: the muted client logs every sound a shot plays to `shots/<name>/sounds.csv` (frame, event, the variant
  chosen, volume, pitch, position; deterministic per seed); actions `sound`, `tune` (a melody on note blocks with
  their particles), `ambience`, `particles`; `cli/videocraft/audio` mixes them onto their frames with distance and
  pan from the camera, voice, an original chiptune bed with stems and cues (`out`, `in`, `drop`, `thin`, `full`,
  `hit`), ducking, silence over black, mastered to −14 LUFS / −1 dBTP; `[edit] audio = "original"` uses no game
  audio; commands `audio mix`, `audio events --onsets`, `audio synth`; `examples/sound.toml`.
- `AGENTS.md`: a "Working with agents" section (orchestrator, builders in worktrees, reviewer agents, probing
  accounts); T3 Craft is linked by its public repository.
- Command groups: `cli.py` loads `videocraft.<group>.commands` (`register(subparsers)`) for `edit`, `audio`, `voice`,
  `sets`, `story`, `review`, `series` and `clips`, so new commands land in their own files instead of `cli.py`.
- Takes in several checkouts at once: each take holds one of three machine-wide slots (control ports
  25750–25752) and waits (`--slot-wait`, default 1800 s) when all are busy; the checkout's pid file records the port,
  so `status` and `stop` find its client; `--port` refuses the ports of other tools; `doctor` shows the slots.
- Renamed from blockreel to videocraft: Java package `io.github.alexandroslekkas.videocraft`, mod id, CLI
  (`bin/videocraft`), system properties (`videocraft.*`), log prefix `VIDEOCRAFT`, world folders `videocraft-*`.
- The foundation: a Fabric mod for Minecraft 26.3 that plays a compiled shot script in a hidden client on a fixed
  frame clock and captures every frame to ffmpeg; the `videocraft` CLI (`doctor`, `compile`, `run`, `cut`, `measure`,
  `runs`, `status`, `stop`); the run store; `examples/hello.toml` (an orbit around spawn, 1080p60).
